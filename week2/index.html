			<p>My name is M.A. Charitha Buddhika Pieris, and I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. I believe that life is a continuous journey of self-discovery, and I am excited to share a glimpse of who I am with you. I was born on the 14th of September in 2002 in the beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka. I am a proud Roman Catholic and a passionate student with a lot of dreams and aspirations.I've had the privilege of attending Maris Stella College in Thimbirigaskatuwa, Negombo, which has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. As a student, I've always strived for excellence, and I'm grateful for the educational opportunities I've received.During my time at Maris Stella College, I actively participated in various school activities, contributing to both my personal growth and the school community. I served as a Former Senior Prefect, a role that taught me leadership, responsibility, and the importance of setting a positive example for my peers. <br><br> One of my true passions is music, and I was proud to be a senior choir member.  Music has always been a source of joy and inspiration for me, and being part of the choir allowed me to express my creativity while working closely with my fellow singers to create beautiful harmonies. Sports have also been an integral part of my life. I had the honor of representing my college in football, where I not only developed my physical skills but also learned valuable lessons about teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship. In addition to football, I also played chess for the college team, a strategic game that challenged my intellect and decision-making abilities.Beyond my school activities, there are several traits that define who I am. I am a dedicated and hardworking individual, always striving to achieve my goals and make the most of every opportunity that comes my way. I am also a good listener and enjoy engaging in meaningful conversations with others to gain different perspectives.As a student, I am committed to my education and eager to continue learning and growing. I believe that every experience, whether inside or outside the classroom, contributes to personal development. My school activities have taught me the importance of balance in life, and I plan to carry these lessons with me into the future. </p>
